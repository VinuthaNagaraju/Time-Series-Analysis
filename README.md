Analysis on time series data to forecast pressure 
The historical weather dataset from Dublin Airport, spanning over eight decades from 1942 to 2023, serves as a
valuable collection for unraveling the patterns of atmospheric
pressure.It consists of 29889 entries and 9 features related to
weather recorded for different dates. As a crucial variable influencing weather dynamics,
atmospheric pressure recorded in hectopascals (cbl) provides
a detailed perspective on the meteorological conditions.The
time series analysis embarks will illuminate the inherent nature
of the atmospheric pressure time series, revealing potential
trends, seasonality, and irregularities.To perform time series analysis different models are applied
such as Naive Forecasting, Moving Averages, Exponential
Smoothing, and SARIMA.
